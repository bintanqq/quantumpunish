## ⛓️ Next-Gen Jail System (v2.0)

Our Jail system is not just a "box". It's a fully immersive punishment experience:

* **Labor-Based Punishment**: Force players to perform "Hard Labor" (breaking blocks) to earn their freedom. Freedom isn't free!
* **Smart Time Pausing**: Introducing `count-offline-time`. If disabled, jail time only ticks down while the player is online. No more "sleeping through" the sentence.
* **Private Packet-Holograms**: Each jailed player sees a personal floating status display showing their remaining time and labor progress. Other players won't see the clutter.
* **Anti-Escape Tech**: Automatic teleport retries and chunk-loading safety ensures no player can glitch out of their cell.
* **Seamless Resume**: All progress and remaining seconds are saved instantly to the database.
