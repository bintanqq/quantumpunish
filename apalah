## 💡 Key Features

### ⏳ Smart Time Pausing
You can decide if jail time should "sleep" when the player is offline. Configure this in `config.yml`:
* `count-offline-time: false`: Time **pauses** when player logs out (Recommended).
* `count-offline-time: true`: Time follows real-world clock (Always ticking).

### 📊 Jail Status
The `/jailstatus` command provides a real-time summary:
* **For Players**: Shows sisa waktu and how many blocks they still need to mine.
* **For Staff**: Use `/jailstatus <player>` to monitor a prisoner's progress and see if they are actually working.

### 🛡️ Private Holograms
As soon as a player is jailed, a **private hologram** appears at their labor location.
* **Performance**: Uses packets (Client-side), so it doesn't lag the server.
* **Privacy**: Only the prisoner can see their own stats; no more messy floating text for others.

> **Pro Tip:** Always set the `setspawner` at a location reachable by the player, or they won't be able to finish their labor!
